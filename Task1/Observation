Dealing with multiple thingd at one time its a concurrency,here I tried to understand this dealing with asyncio library with the 
help of python script .
Concurrency can be implemented and is used a lot on single processing units, 
nonetheless it may benefit from multiple processing units with respect to speed. 
If an operating system is called a multi-tasking operating system, this is a synonym for supporting concurrency.
If you can load multiple documents simultaneously in the tabs of your browser and you can still open menus and perform more actions, 
this is concurrency. If you run distributed-net computations in the background, that is concurrency.
Two tasks T1 and T2 are concurrent if the order in which the two tasks are executed in time is not predetermined,
T1 may be executed and finished before T2,
T2 may be executed and finished before T1,
T1 and T2 may be executed simultaneously at the same instance of time (parallelism),

T1 and T2 may be executed alternatively.
